## description

Landing page project for egFWD web professional track

- The page consists of a navigation bar and sections that are set to active when in view
- The navigation bar is dynamically built using DOM manipulation through createElement(),appendChild() and innerHtml() functions, starting with an empty ul then adding its li.
- Active sections are differentiated by knowing the position relative to viewport during scrolling using .getBoundingClientRect() function
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls smoothly to its related section

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
