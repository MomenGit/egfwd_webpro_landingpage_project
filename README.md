- The page consists of a navigation bar and sections that are set to active when in view
- The navigation bar is dynamically built using DOM manipulation through createElement(),appendChild() and innerHtml() functions, starting with an empty ul then adding its li.
- Active sections are differentiated by knowing the position relative to viewport during scrolling using .getBoundingClientRect() function
- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls smoothly to its related section
